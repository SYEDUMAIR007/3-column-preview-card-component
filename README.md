## Overview
Frontend mentor is a great companion for learning frontend development. This challenge was slightly complicated as i didnt had the figma or sketch files but im happy that i could make it as realistic as possible.
### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process
I first went on to design my own mockup of the design using figma and then took mobile-first css approach. I used grid slightly in this project.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
I learned use of css grid properly here.

### Continued development

From now on im going to create mockups first because believe me it saves a lot of time and the develoment becomes faster and always have mobile-first css approach.

### Useful resources

- [Figma](https://www.figma.com) - This helped me for buildin the mockup . I really liked this pattern of building mockups first and will use it going forward.
-[Kevin powell yt channel](https://youtu.be/rg7Fvvl3taU)-Kevin's video was short and upto the point. It is the best explanation of css grid on yt.
